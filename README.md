# Virtual Interior Design
# Use Case:
Basically, this app has some preloaded furniture designs and we can view how it looks to have that furniture around in our home and view and decide whether it can fit or not. Before making any real purchases, users may virtually arrange and test furniture in their homes using the app. They can use this to see how various furniture pieces will fit and seem in their room.
# Functionality:
1.	Launch the App
2.	Give Camera Permissions
3.	Point the Camera Towards an Open Space:
•	Once camera permissions are granted, users point their device's camera toward an open space in their surroundings. The app uses the camera feed to scan and understand the physical environment.
4.	See a Plane:
•	As the camera scans the environment, the app identifies a flat surface, often referred to as a "plane." This could be a section of the floor or any other suitable flat area in view of the camera. The app visually indicates this plane, perhaps by highlighting it on the screen.
5.	Object Placement:
•	Once the user taps on the plane, the app responds by placing a virtual object at the selected location.
6.	Compare with the Room:
•	After the virtual object is placed, users have the opportunity to visually assess and compare how the virtual object fits into the real-world environment.
# Limitations:
Currently, we only have 3 furniture models. Later on, we can add multiple designs to the app whenever we want.
